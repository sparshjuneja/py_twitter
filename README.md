# py_twitter
It is a project to get the *follower ids* of all the **twitter handles** listed in a excel sheet. This sort of technique is useful
for `Growth Hacking`, which is the latest buzz word in marketing. You can concentrate on a particular set of audience and get targeted
results.

**Twitter_handles.ipynb** is the *jupyter notebook* to fetch the follower ids of the twitter handles mentioned in the excel sheet
and then output the results into a .csv file just for convenience.
